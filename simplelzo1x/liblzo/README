This directory contains statically 32/64-bit compiled libraries for LZO version 1.00.
Only the necessary headers for the LZO1X algorithm were included, as they are the only ones that are needed for E-Safenet compression.

Here's a link to LZO 1.00 (which is the exact version we encountered in E-Safenet encrypted files): https://files.scene.org/view/mirrors/hornet/code/compress/lzo100.zip.
